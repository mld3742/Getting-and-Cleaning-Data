Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================
Course 3 Course Project
-------------------------
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity     and each subject.


Process for the Project:
-------------------------
 1. Download the data source and place in a folder on your local computer.
 Here are the data for the project:

 2. Place run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dateset. You must set this as your working directory.
 3. Run source("run_analysis.R") to generate a new file called tiny_data.txt in your working directory
